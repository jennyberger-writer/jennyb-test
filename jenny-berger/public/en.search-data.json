{"/about/":{"data":{"":"Hi, I’m Jenny and I’m a technical writer living in New Hampshire, USA.\nI’ve been a technical communicator since the 2000s. I made the jump from regular (and boring) office work because:\nI always ended up writing in every job, even though those jobs never originally included writing. I enjoyed learning about new technologies that could help me solve problems in my day-to-day work. I wanted to put my existing skills to better use in an environment that would also position me to develop new skills. I don’t have a technical background, but I’ve managed to hold my own with the product engineers, testers, and architects I’ve worked with. Over the years, I’ve built a reputation with coworkers for making life easier whenever possible.","contact-me#Contact me":"Feel free to send me an email or message me on LinkedIn.","little-known-facts#Little known facts":" In my life, I’ve lived somewhere in 4 of the 5 US regions. I’m better at virtual photography than real-world photography. I’m a good cook and a decent baker. When I worked in an office, I secretly offloaded the excess of my culinary experiments on the dev team.

For what I use it for, it’s comically overpowered. Still, buying on the higher end of the market means:\nI don’t have to worry about whether my machine can handle the software needed for virtually any work task. I won’t have to worry about replacing my machine with a new one for at least 8 years, barring some sort of quantum leap in new operating systems or a drastic change in my computing needs. Dual monitors: I don’t use them because I find them unwieldy. Instead, I use one big monitor.","logo#Logo":"The image I’m using for my logo on this site was generated using Bitmoji. In previous jobs, I used this image wherever a profile pic was needed. Maybe sometime I’ll have a proper logo made.","software#Software":" Hugo, a static site generator.
