Hi, I'm Jenny and I'm a technical writer living in New Hampshire, USA.

I've been a technical communicator since the 2000s. I made the jump from regular (and boring) office work because:

-  I always ended up writing in every job, even though those jobs never originally included writing.
-  I enjoyed learning about new technologies that could help me solve problems in my day-to-day work.
-  I wanted to put my existing skills to better use in an environment that would also position me to develop new skills.

I don't have a technical background, but I've managed to hold my own with the product engineers, testers, and architects I've worked with. Over the years, I've built a reputation with coworkers for making life easier whenever possible.

## Little known facts

-  In my life, I've lived somewhere in 4 of the 5 US regions.
-  I'm better at virtual photography than real-world photography.
-  I'm a good cook and a decent baker. When I worked in an office, I secretly offloaded the excess of my culinary experiments on the dev team.
