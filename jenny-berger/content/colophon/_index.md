This site is an experiment: partly to help me talk about my professional accomplishments, partly to collect some thoughts in one place, and partly to illustrate my proficiency with certain kinds of technology.

On this page, I talk about what I use to build this site.

## Software

-  [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator.
-  [Hextra](https://github.com/imfing/hextra), a clean and sensible theme for Hugo.
-  [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), for formatting content.
-  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), a code editor for configuring the site and authoring content.
-  [Git](https://git-scm.com/), to manage changes to the files in this site.
-  [GitHub](https://github.com/), to corral files in one place and publish content as a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site.

## Hardware

My computer is a custom build that would normally be aimed at hardcore gamers. For what I use it for, it's comically overpowered. Still, buying on the higher end of the market means:

-  I don't have to worry about whether my machine can handle the software needed for virtually any work task.
-  I won't have to worry about replacing my machine with a new one for at least 8 years, barring some sort of quantum leap in new operating systems or a drastic change in my computing needs.

Dual monitors: I don't use them because I find them unwieldy. Instead, I use one big monitor.

## Logo

The image I'm using for my logo on this site was generated using Bitmoji. In previous jobs, I used this image wherever a profile pic was needed. Maybe sometime I'll have a proper logo made.
